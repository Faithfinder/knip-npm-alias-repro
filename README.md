# Knip Minimal Reproduction

This is a template with only Knip (and TypeScript) pre-installed.

Add files and configuration to this project to create a minimal reproduction of the issue:

- Add source files
- Add relevant TypeScript configuration (in `tsconfig.json`)
- Add relevant Knip configuration (in `knip.json` or `knip.ts`)
- Install and double-check the latest versions of Knip and TypeScript

You can use the terminal inside this project to run Knip from the root of the project with `npx knip`.
